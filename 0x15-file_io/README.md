## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
What are file descriptors
What are the 3 standard file descriptors, what are their purpose and what are their POSIX names
How to use the I/O system calls open, close, read and write
What are and how to use the flags O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR
What are file permissions, and how to set them when creating a file with the open system call
What is a system call
What is the difference between a function and a system call

## Description of what each file shows:
0.  a function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
1. a function that creates a file.
2. a function that appends text at the end of a file.
3. a program that copies the content of a file to another file.
