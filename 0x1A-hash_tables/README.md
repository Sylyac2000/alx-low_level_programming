## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
What is a hash function
What makes a good hash function
What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Description of what each file shows:
0. function that creates a hash table
1. function that implements well known ```djb2``` hash function algorithm
2. function that gives you the index of a key.
3. function that adds an element to hash table
4. function that retrieves a value given a key
5. function that prints a hast table
6. function that deletes a hash table
