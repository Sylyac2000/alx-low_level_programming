## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
What are structures, when, why and how to use them
How to use typedef

## Description of what each file shows:
0. dog.h - define a new type struct dog with the following elements: name, age, owner
1. a function that initializes a variable of type struct dog and sets values given via arguments
2. a function that prints a struct dog and it's information
3. dog.h - define a new type dog_t as a new name for the type struct dog
4. a function that creates a new instance of the struct dog
5. a function that frees an instance of the struct dog
