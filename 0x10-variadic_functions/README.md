## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
What are variadic functions
How to use va_start, va_arg and va_end macros
Why and how to use the const type qualifier

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that returns the sum of all its parameters
1. a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line
2. a function that prints strings, followed by a new line
3. a function that prints anything: char, int, float, string
