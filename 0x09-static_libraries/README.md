## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
* what a static library is
* how it works
* how to create one
* how to use it

## Description of what each file shows:
1. libmy.a - created this static library containing some functions
2. main.h - included function prototypes of functions in library
3. create_static_lib.sh - shell script to compile pre linking and create static library
