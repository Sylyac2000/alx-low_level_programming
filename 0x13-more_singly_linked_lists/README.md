## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
How to use linked lists
Start to look for the right source of information without too much help

## Description of what each file shows:
0. a function that prints all the elements of a listint_t list
1. a function that returns the number of elements in a linked listint_t list
2. a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a listint_t list
3. a function that adds a new node at the end of a listint_t list
4. a function that frees a listint_t list
5. a function that frees a listint_t list
6. a function that deletes the head node of a listint_t linked list, and returns the head nodeâ€™s data (n)
7. a function that returns the nth node of a listint_t linked list
8. a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a listint_t linked list
9. a function that inserts a new node at a given position
10. a function that deletes the node at index index of a listint_t linked list
