* Compiler: gcc 9.3.0
* Style guidelines: [Betty style] (https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki)

## Synopsis
This repository holds some projects I worked on for ALX. The goal is to learn coding and concepts through the C programming language.

## Concepts to be learned in this repository:
Look for the right source of information without too much help
How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Description of what each file shows:
0. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number
2. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
5. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
